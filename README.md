# The-Developer-Cookbook
This is a fun project for devs to express their love for food through their native language(s). It's an open source project open to contribution. As more people become interested we may create a governance structure, but for now I'll act as BDFL. To some degree I would love for this to act in some way as a teaching resource for individuals who want to learn about syntax for different languages and how to operate in FOSS projects... but to start I just want to put some awesome recipes in code.
