# The-Developer-Cookbook
This is a fun project for devs to express their love for food through their native language(s). It's an open source project open to contribution. As more people become interested we may create a governance structure, but for now I'll act as BDFL. To some degree I would love for this to act in some way as a teaching resource for individuals who want to learn about syntax for different languages and how to operate in FOSS projects... but to start I just want to put some awesome recipes in code. To some degree this is also just a satirical social commentary on how engineers can always find a way to overcomplicate things.

## File Structure
I'm thinking we organize recipes by language, then by some type of dish classification system. I'd also love to see different operations (like "dice") turned into "re-usable" functions in a commons library. If we really want to get hardcore about it, we could define objects for different ingredients. I'll be honest, I have no idea where this could go but I'm excited :P.
